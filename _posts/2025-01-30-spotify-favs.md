Music is probably the most accurate personality test I’ve ever taken, tho i am using gpt to generate this md blog
In 2025, my Spotify basically said:

> “She listens to everything… and she means EVERYTHING.”

So here are some of my absolute favorites this year — no skips, no shame.

---

## 🎶 1. K-pop Nostalgia Hits (aka my emotional damage section/i am already old man let me have some 2000 throwbacks)

Some songs are not just songs… they are entire eras.

- **DAY BY DAY** — T-ARA  
- **Cry Cry** — T-ARA  
- **Haru Haru** — BIGBANG  
- **FIRST LOVE (feat. EB)** — T-ARA  

If you know you know.

## 🎤 2. Rap / Hip-hop Narratives (main character energy)

When I want lyrics, storytelling, and dramatic beats:

- **luther (with SZA)** — Kendrick Lamar  
- **squabble up** — Kendrick Lamar  
- **Money Trees** — Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock  
- **No Role Modelz** — J. Cole  
- **Pt. 2** — Kanye West  
- **God’s Plan** — Drake  

Basically therapy but louder.

## 👑 3. Pop Divas & Chaos (Lady Gaga owns my soul, i LOVE Artpop!!!!)

This category is pure confidence and camp.

- **Government Hooker** — Lady Gaga  
- **Judas** — Lady Gaga  
- **Scheiße** — Lady Gaga  
- **Monster** — Lady Gaga  
- **Abracadabra** — Lady Gaga  
- **Applause** — Lady Gaga  

You want *ICON music* trust me.

## 💃 4. Dance / EDM Boosters (for hustling me ass to class)

- **Say My Name** — David Guetta, Bebe Rexha  
- **I’m Good (Blue)** — Bebe Rexha  
- **Ten More Days** — Avicii  
- **Rollin (feat. Future & Khalid)** — Calvin Harris  

These songs automatically increase my walking speed by 30%, said my apple watch.

## 🌙 5. Night Vibes & International Flavor (now the emo time you better be crying with me)

My playlist also travels across languages:
